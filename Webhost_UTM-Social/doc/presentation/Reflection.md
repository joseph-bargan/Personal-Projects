For the entire project, we decided to separate the back end and front end responsibilties between the two members. This greatly helped 
the project development by removing the chances of overwriting each others code as well as making testing easier. Due to the unforseen 
circumstances causing the loss of three of the members, another great technique we used was to lower the scope of the project from being
an app to a website which was helpful for us as it allowed us to not have to learn an entire new development cycle using app development
technologies and languages. The use of widely used and easy to learn languages and frameworks such as node.js and HTML as well as a 
familiar database in mongodb allowed us to focus mostly on the development process rather than learning new technologies. We would have 
changed the user story completion schedule to be more strict to allow for basic and important stories to be completed much before they
are due for the sprint. Also, for future projects we would change the IDE to Visual code instead of Visual Studio due to the annoying
behaviour and lack of control it offers for github integration. An ideal process for the team if we were to continue the project would
be to add another team member we trust to help with some of the overhead responsibilities both Sidharth and Joseph have. We could make
the above mentioned changes while keep the things that worked the same. We would change the design process to include a cloud hosting 
service for the website to run it remotely and allow for it to be published and listed. We would change our login implementation to 
include UofT acorn login credentials for the students.
