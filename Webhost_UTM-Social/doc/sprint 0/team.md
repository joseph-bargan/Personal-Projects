Team name: Parallel Programming

Team Members:

Sidharth Bajwa - bajwasid

Joseph Bargan - barganjo

Method of communication:

WhatsApp group chat

Meeting:

Send message first and meet at school at agreed upon time and day OR a online meeting will be conducted 
using zoom.

Communication response time:

We expect each group member to respond the message within the same day of receiving it.
If we decide to meet tomorrow, then each member is expected to reply to the message the
same day before the meeting.

Division of Work:

First seperate work into parts and choose what each one wants to do,
and then agree on how to do the unchoosed parts together.

Submitting:

Sidharth will make sure that everything needed is submitted and make sure that it is complete and correct.
At least one day before the deadline, we will meet and make sure that everyone know what work is
being submitted. Joseph will pull the repository before the due date at a new location and make sure everything
committed is in there.


Contigency Planning:

If one of the group members drops the course, the professor will be notified and furthur action will be decided
due to the size of the group being two.
If a member does not finish his part on time, we will meet at school and work together to make sure that
it is completed by the due date. This will only be allowed once as the next time the work is late, it will 
notified to the professor and a deduction in marks will be decided.
If someone is academicly dishonest, we will report to the professor immediately.
