Objective:

We are developing a forum website where only students and falculty members from University of Toronto 
are allowed to register for an account and post and reply to messages on it.

The users need to sign up using their UofT email, and will verify the email address.

Key Users:

The key users for this project will be university students and faculty members.

Scenarios:

Students who are part of a club or school events can post announcements for UTMSU events for all to see. Example: announcement for
changes to day or time of free breakfast Wednesdays. 
Students in various courses and subject POSTS can buy or sell their textbooks by posting an ad and others can reply to the post.
Students in courses that need group members for projects or for personal projects can find them here. 

Features:

- The website allows users to post messages and pictures as well as comment and reply to those posts.

- The usernames on the posts can chosen to be anonymous so that the identity of the owner of a post stays unknown to other users.

- Users are also allowed to change their passwords.

- Forum will have sub categories/topics such as departments/majors (computer science, economic, statstic etc.) or 
general categories such as "textbook" for selling textbooks. This allows users to post under the relevent topic so they can communicate easier.

- A search feature for users to search the entire forum with a specific keyword.
