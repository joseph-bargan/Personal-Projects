To communicate, we use What'sApp's group feature, where all of the members are in it and we expected everyone to check the message as soon as possible, to be more specific, within 24 hours.

To work on the project, each person will have to spend their outside class time and we work the majority of the time alone, without everyong sitting together. However, we will conduct at least 2 meetings for each scrum. The first one for disscussing and seperating the work after the due date of the previous scrum and the second one for checking the work before the due date of the new one. We will disscuss online about any decision that we need to make or any problem while working on a user story. If we have some major decision or problem, we will arrange for additional meetings. The average meeting for a scrum will be around 3-4 for each phase.


To work as a team, we need to agree on the same decisions, so that everyone will follow what we all agreed on. We definbe the priority of the user sotries according to the importance of the features. If the user story represents a major feature, then it is more important than others. For example, posting messages should be more imporant than search key words, since witout the first feature, the app will be missing its most imporant features. We disscuss together at meeting to order the importance of the user stories. On average, we have 2 rounds of voting, first one for expressing each member's idea and the second one for convincing each other.


In addition to agreeing on the same decision, we should also make a remark a problem or dificulties are encountered so that the problem stays unsolved until the due date of the user story. So it is the responsability of each member to report the problem in the group chat as soon as possible. We could then make any arrangement or meeting to solve the problem.
