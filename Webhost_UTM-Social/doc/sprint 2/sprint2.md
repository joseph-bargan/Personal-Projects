The goal for this sprint was to decide as a group the new scope of the project. User stories were re-evaluated and the scope of the 
project was lowered to match the team capacity. The group recieved starter code for the porject from the instructor and the majority 
of the sprint was used to understand it. Major user stories completed during the sprint were:

1. Having a basic register page for the website which led to a post page but no functionality.
2. Integration of the database with JavaScript files but no connection with actual website or storing of user data.

Participants: 
Sidharth Bajwa
Joseph Bargan

Contribution: Both members had a meeting and decided the above mentioned responsibilities and changes to be made to the project as 
well as study the starter code to get the basic stories started.

For the upcoming sprint, Sidharth will be working on implementing the UI for the website and its various pages and Jospeh will be 
working on the server side, implementing login and register functionality.
